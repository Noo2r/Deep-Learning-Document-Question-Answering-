# 📄 DocuMindAI – Deep Learning Project

DocuMindAI is an **Intelligent Document Question Answering (Q&A) System** based on **Deep Learning** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
The project allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions in natural language, receiving context-aware answers instead of keyword-based results.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Traditional PDF search relies on keyword matching and lacks semantic understanding.  
DocuMindAI solves this problem by combining **semantic retrieval** with a **fine-tuned transformer model**, enabling intelligent interaction with documents using natural language.
